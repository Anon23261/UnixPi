- Circuit management
- Security kill switch

## Quick Start

### Installation

1. Download the latest release:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anon23261/UnixPi.git
cd UnixPi
```

2. Create SD card image:
```bash
sudo ./scripts/create_image.sh
```

3. Write to SD card:
```bash
sudo ./scripts/write_to_sd.sh /dev/sdX  # Replace X with your SD card device
```

The image includes:
- Pre-installed Raspberry Pi firmware
- Auto-configuration on first boot
- Default user setup (username: ghost, password: ghost23!)
- Security hardening and monitoring
- Full IoT security toolkit

### First Boot

1. Insert SD card into Raspberry Pi Zero W and power on
2. Wait for initial setup to complete
3. Login with default credentials:
   - Username: ghost
   - Password: ghost23!

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Run security scan
secure-scan

# Start monitoring
secure-monitor

# Create backup
secure-backup

# Check system status
secure-status
```

## Development

### Setup Development Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Run tests
pytest tests/
```
